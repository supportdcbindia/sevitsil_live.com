      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="mb-3">The mat is typically made of a silicone material that is non-reactive, non-slip, and easy to clean, making it ideal for use in medical applications. The silicone surgical mat is designed to provide a barrier between the surgical area and surrounding surfaces, such as the operating room table or surgical tray. The mat is usually placed directly on the surface and can be easily removed and replaced as needed.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">The silicone material used in the surgical mat is also heat-resistant, making it suitable for use in procedures where high temperatures may be involved, such as cauterization or electrocautery. The mat can also be used to protect delicate instruments and equipment from damage during surgery.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">The use of a silicone surgical mat is an important safety measure in surgical procedures, as it helps to reduce the risk of contamination and infection. The mat also helps to maintain a clean and organized surgical environment, which can improve efficiency and reduce the risk of errors or complications.</p>
      <p>Silicone surgical mats are available in a range of sizes and shapes to suit different surgical procedures and settings. They can also be customized with various features, such as color-coded borders or specialized cutouts, to meet the specific needs of different surgical teams and procedures.</p>
