      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="mb-3">These connectors are used in medical settings to allow for the transfer of fluids without the use of a needle. The gasket is an important part of the connector as it creates a seal between the two parts, ensuring that there is no leakage of fluids.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">The silicone material used in these gaskets is ideal for medical applications because it is biocompatible, meaning it is not harmful to living tissue. It is also flexible, durable, and resistant to high temperatures and chemicals.</p>
      <p>The use of needle-free connectors and gaskets has become increasingly popular in medical settings due to the reduced risk of needlestick injuries and the potential for improved infection control.</p>
